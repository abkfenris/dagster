## Overview

In Dagster, code is executed within an [op](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops). Sometimes this code can fail for transiant reasons, and the desired behavior is to retry and run the function again.

Dagster provides both declarative <PyObject module="dagster" object="RetryPolicy"  />s as well as manual <PyObject module="dagster" object="RetryRequested" /> exceptions to enable this behavior.

## Using Op Retries

Here we start off with our op that is causing us to have to retry the whole job anytime it fails.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/retries.py startafter=problem_start endbefore=problem_end
@op
def problematic():
    fails_sometimes()
```

### RetryPolicy

To get this solid to retry when an excpetion occurs, we can attach a <PyObject module="dagster" object="RetryRequested" />.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/retries.py startafter=policy_start endbefore=policy_end
@op(retry_policy=RetryPolicy())
def better():
    fails_sometimes()
```

This improves the situation, but we may need additional configuration to control how many times to retry and/or how long to wait between each retry.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/retries.py startafter=policy2_start endbefore=policy2_end
@op(
    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(
        max_retries=3,
        delay=0.2,  # 200ms
        backoff=Backoff.EXPONENTIAL,
        jitter=Jitter.PLUS_MINUS,
    )
)
def even_better():
    fails_sometimes()
```

In addition to being able to set the policy directly on the op definition, it can also be set on specific invocations of an op, or a <PyObject module="dagster" object="job" decorator /> to apply to all ops contained within.

### RetryRequested

In ceratin more nuanced situations, we may need to evaluate code to determine if we want to retry or not. For this we can use a manual <PyObject module="dagster" object="RetryRequested" /> exception.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/retries.py startafter=manual_start endbefore=manual_end
@op
def manual():
    try:
        fails_sometimes()
    except Exception as e:
        if should_retry(e):
            raise RetryRequested(max_retries=1, seconds_to_wait=1) from e
        else:
            raise
```

Using `raise from` will ensure the original exceptions information is captured by Dagster.
